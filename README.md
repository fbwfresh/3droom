Software Design & Development Approach
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first identifying user needs and system requirements. I create conceptual models, such as flowcharts or wireframes, to outline functionality and structure. Then, I iteratively develop prototypes, incorporating feedback and refining the design.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My project has helped me improve UI/UX design, modular software architecture planning, and data visualization techniques.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process that included research, wireframing, prototyping, testing, and refining the design based on user feedback.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design cycle and modular development approach can be applied to future projects to improve efficiency, scalability, and usability.

Program Development
How do I approach developing programs?
I develop programs by following a structured approach: planning, designing, implementing, testing, and refining. I focus on modularity, maintainability, and efficiency.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used optimization techniques like level-of-detail rendering and procedural generation to enhance performance and automation.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration allowed me to continuously improve functionality, optimize performance, and refine the user experience based on testing and feedback.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach evolved from focusing on basic functionality to prioritizing efficiency, scalability, and maintainability through modular code and improved documentation.

Computer Science & Future Applications
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science enables me to solve complex problems, automate processes, and develop software that aligns with my career and personal goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations enhance my ability to represent data visually, improving my skills in data science, engineering simulations, and user experience design.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
They provide skills in UI/UX development, data visualization for decision-making, and interactive design, which are applicable in software development, business intelligence, and AI-driven applications.
